        Thank you for using pencil.domains. We are committed to protecting your privacy and, for that reason, we have

        services (including its website, and mobile and web-based applications, and any other tools, products, or
        services provided by Pencil Works, LLC that link to or reference this Privacy Policy) (collectively, the
        “Services”). The Services are owned and operated by Pencil Works, LLC, a Newark liability company (“we”, “us” or
        “our”).
        This Privacy Policy applies to information Pencil Works, LLC collects through the Services, as well as other
        information provided to us online or offline by third parties, when we associate that information with customers
        or users of the Services; however, it does not apply to information collected from our employees, contractors,
        or vendors. It also does not apply to information that you share with third parties or is collected by third
        parties through the Services (including web traffic or crash analytics tools). You acknowledge and agree that
        Pencil Works, LLC is not responsible for the data collection or use practices of any other Services user or
        third party utilized in providing the Services.
        This Privacy Policy describes, among other things:
        <ul>
          <li>Personal and other information we collect about you;</li>
          <li>How we use your information;</li>
          <li>How we may share your information with third parties; and</li>
          <li>Your choices regarding the personal information we collect about you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong> Consent</strong></li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        By accessing or using the Services, you consent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy
        Policy, please do not access or use the Services. Information gathered through the Services may be transferred,
        used, and stored in the United States or in other countries where our service providers or we are located. If
        you use the Services, you agree to the transfer, use, and storage of your Personal Information (as defined
        below) in those countries. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not
        be as comprehensive as those in your country. You agree that all transactions relating to the Services or
        pencil.domains are deemed to occur in the United States, where our servers are located.
        <p>
        <ol start="2">
          <li><strong> Collection of Your Personal and Other Information</strong></li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        When you register for, or use our Services, we collect Personal Information. By “Personal Information” we mean
        information that can identify an individual, such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Names;</li>
          <li>Personal or business addresses;</li>
          <li>Email addresses;</li>
          <li>Phone numbers;</li>
          <li>Social Security numbers;</li>
          <li>Government-issued identification numbers;
            Unique identifiers (arbitrary codes or series of characters we create or are provided from a third party to
            identify unique users or devices) that are connected or may reasonably be connected to your identity; and
          </li>
          <li>Information contained in any profile you submit to us<em>.</em></li>
        </ul>
        &nbsp;
        You may choose not to provide Personal Information, (subject to the controls offered by your mobile device’s
        operating system), but this may prevent you from receiving certain features of the Services.

        We also collect non-Personal Information relating to the Services, that is, information that does not personally
        identify an individual. The non-Personal Information we collect includes how you interact with the Services,
        information generally collected or “logged” by Internet websites or Internet services when accessed or used by
        users, and information about your web browser or device accessing or using the Services.
        Examples of the non-Personal Information we collect are:
        <ul>
          <li>Your Internet Protocol (IP address);</li>
          <li>Information about your computer or mobile device, such as its maker or operating system version, and HTTP
            header information;</li>
          <li>The pages of our website that you viewed during a visit;</li>
          <li>What information or content you view or interact with using the Services;</li>
          <li>The city and state in which you are located (but not your precise geographic location); and</li>
          <li>Unique identifiers that are not connected and cannot reasonably be connected to your identity.</li>
        </ul>
        &nbsp;
        We will not use non-Personal Information to try to identify you, and if we associate any non-Personal
        Information with information that personally identifies you, then we will treat it as Personal Information. As
        discussed in more detail below, we sometimes use cookies and other automatic information gathering technologies
        to gather non-Personal Information.
        Information collected by the Services may be collected by us or one of our service providers acting on our
        behalf, but in either case, this Privacy Policy will govern the collection, use, and sharing of the information.

        We may disclose your Personal Information to third parties as described below.
        We may disclose Personal Information to provide the Services, or when you authorize or instruct us to do so, for
        example when authorize us to share your Personal Information with domain registries and other registrars in
        order to add your domain to the WHOIS database, or when you choose to sell your domain through one of our
        third-party service providers like Escrow.com. We may also disclose Personal Information and non-Personal
        Information to companies, agents, contractors, service providers, or others engaged to perform functions on our
        behalf (such as processing of payments, provision of data storage, hosting of our website, marketing of our
        products and services, conducting audits, and performing web analytics). We may license third party software to
        include in or use with the Services, in which case we may disclose Personal Information and/or Non-Personal
        Information to the licensor.
        &nbsp;
        We may also disclose your Personal Information to third parties when we believe, in good faith and in our sole
        discretion, that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) enforce or apply the terms and conditions of the
        Services, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (b) comply with legal or regulatory
        requirements or an enforceable governmental request, (c) protect the rights, property or safety of us, our users
        or other third parties, (d) prevent a crime or protect national security, or (e) detect, prevent or otherwise
        address fraud, security or technical issues.
        Finally, we reserve the right to transfer information (including your Personal Information) to a third party in
        the event of a sale, merger, or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of our company relating to
        the Services, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, or receivership of our business. We will
        use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you of such transfer, for example via email or by posting notice
        on our website.
        Lastly, we may also disclose non-Personal Information, aggregated with information about our other users, to our
        clients, business partners, merchants, advertisers, investors, potential buyers and other third parties if we
        deem such disclosure, in our sole discretion, to have sound business reasons or justifications.

        Every time you use the Services (e.g., access a Service webpage, navigate to a specific location within the
        Service mobile app), we collect non-Personal Information (discussed above in Section 2) regarding that use. For
        example, to improve our Services, we collect how, when, and which parts of the Services or its features you use.
        Also, we may use your device’s unique identifier (UDID), media access control address (MAC Address), or other
        unique identifiers to assist us in collecting and analyzing this data.
        To assist us in collecting and storing this non-Personal Information, we may employ a variety of technologies,
        including “Cookies,” and local browser storage. A “Cookie” is a small amount of data a website operator, or a
        third party whose content is embedded in that website, may store in your web browser and that the website
        operator or, as applicable, the third party, can access when you visit the website. A Cookie may also refer to
        web-browser-based storage provided by Adobe’s Flash plugin (a “Flash Cookie”). The Service’s Cookies may contain
        user preferences, unique identifiers, and other non-Personal Information.
        Your operating system and web browser may allow you to erase information stored in Cookies, Flash Cookies, and
        local browser storage. But if you do so, you may be forced to login to the Services again and you may lose some
        preferences or settings. You may also be able to set your browser to refuse all website storage or to indicate
        when it is permitted, but some features of our Services may not function properly without it. We may use Cookies
        to keep you logged in, save your preferences for the Services, and to collect information about how you use our
        Services.
        More information about managing Cookies is available <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">here</a>. Cookie

        You may request access to your Personal Information by sending an email to <a
          href="mailto:it@pencil.domains">it@pencil.domains</a> . We will try to locate and provide you with your
        Personal Information and give you the opportunity to correct this data, if it is inaccurate, or to delete it, at
        your request. But, in either case, we may need to retain it for legal reasons or for legitimate business
        purposes. You may also remove any content that you post to the Services using the deletion or removal options
        within the Service. However, we (and you) are not able to control information that you have already shared with
        other users or made available to third parties through the Services.
        If you need further assistance with removing any content you posted through the Services, you can email us at <a
          href="mailto:it@pencil.domains">it@pencil.domains</a> . Removal of your posted content may not ensure complete
        or comprehensive removal from our computer systems.
        We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected, or
        removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive
        or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, would be extremely
        impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backups), or relate to information that
        is not associated with your Personal Information. In any case, where we provide information access and
        correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.
        Please be aware thatif you request us to delete your Personal Information, you may not be able to continue to
        use the Services. Also, even if you request that we delete your Personal Information, we may need to retain
        certain information for a limited period of time to satisfy our legal, audit and/or dispute resolution
        requirements.
        We may use third-party service providers that collect information for interest-based advertising purposes
        (advertisements that are tailored to your likely interests, based on categories in which you have shown an
        interest). To learn more about these third parties and the choices they offer users, please visit the Network

        We support the development and implementation of a standard "do not track" browser feature that provides
        customers with control over the collection and use of information about their web-browsing activities. Once a
        standardized "do not track" feature is released, we intend to adhere to the browser settings accordingly.
        You can opt out of receiving marketing e-mails from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link in the e-mails.
        Please note that it may take up to ten (10) business days for your opt-out request to be processed. Also, even
        if you opt out of marketing e-mails, we may continue to send you certain account-related e-mails, such as
        notices about your account and confirmations of transactions you have requested.

        </p>
        We utilize reasonable information security measures to safeguard your Personal Information against unauthorized
        access, modification, or destruction. For example, we utilize Secure Socket Layer (SSL), Transport Layer
        Security (TLS), or similar encryption technology when sensitive data is transmitted over the Internet, and use
        firewalls to help prevent external access into our network. However, no data transmission over the Internet and
        no method of data storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially
        acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its security.
        We restrict access to Personal Information to our employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that
        information in order to operate, develop, improve or support our Services.

          <li><strong> Your California Privacy Rights</strong></li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        A California resident who has provided Personal Information to a business with whom he/she has established a
        business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California Customer”) is entitled to request
        information about whether the business has disclosed Personal Information to any third parties for the third
        parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of Personal
        Information, upon receipt of a request by a California Customer, the business is required to provide a list of
        all third parties to whom Personal Information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list
        of the categories of Personal Information that were disclosed.
        However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts
        and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing a customer’s Personal Information
        to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the
        disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with
        the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of Personal Information to third
        parties for direct marketing purposes and providing a cost free means to exercise that right. To prevent
        disclosure of your Personal Information for use in direct marketing by a third party for its own purposes, do
        not opt in to or authorize such use when you provide Personal Information through the Services. Please note that
        whenever you allow your Personal Information to be shared with a third party to communicate with you, your
        information will be subject to that third party’s privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that
        third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly. You should always review
        the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your
        information.
        California Customers may request further information about our compliance with California’s privacy law by
        e-mailing <a href="mailto:it@pencil.domains">it@pencil.domains</a> .Please note that we are only required to
        respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means
        other than through this e-mail address.

        policy on this page. You can always check the “Last Updated” date at the top of this document to see when the
        Privacy Policy was last changed. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by
        reasonable means, which may be by e-mail or posting a notice of the changes on our website prior to the changes
        becoming effective. We encourage you to check this Privacy Policy from time to time. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO
